<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>

I’m a PhD student at the <ext_link href="https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/">Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems (LCAS)</ext_link>, University of Lincoln (UK). My direct advisors are Prof. <a class="ext_link" href="https://nbellotto.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/">Nicola Bellotto</a> and Prof. <a class="ext_link" href="https://www.hanheide.net/">Marc Hanheide</a>.
<br><br>
Before joining the L-CAS, I graduated from Sapienza University of Rome with a MSc in “Control Engineering” advised by Prof. <a class="ext_link" href="https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/ANTONIO-CARCATERRA_nC1827_EN.aspx">Antonio Carcaterra</a> and, with a BSc in “Computer Science and Control Engineering” advised by Prof. <a class="ext_link" href="http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/deluca/">Alessandro De Luca</a>.

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>The goal of my research is to make robots being able to learn from the human feedback and improve their behaviour by acting in the real world. In practise, I am working with Learning by Demonstration, Reinforcement Learning and Gaussian Processes. I am also doing Robot Software Engineering so that our tour guide robot can safely and reliably be between humans.</p>
