<h2>Biography</h2>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>
I am currently involved in the European H2020 <a class="ext_link" href="https://darko-project.eu/">DARKO</a> project. The goal of my research is to make robots able to learn the effect of their behaviours by observing how humans react to the robot’s actions. Pratically, I am working with Causal discovery and reasoning in Human Robot Spatial Interaction (HRSI).
