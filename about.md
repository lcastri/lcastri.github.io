<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a class="ext_link" href="https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/wp/">Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems (L-CAS)</a>, University of Lincoln (UK), currently working on the TopFleets project in partnership with <a class="ext_link" href="https://jabas.ai/">JABAS AI</a>. I recently obtained my Ph.D. in AI and Robotics at the same institution, where my research focused on developing causal inference frameworks to enhance robot autonomy, specifically regarding decision-making in human-shared environments. My doctoral research was advised by Prof. <a class="ext_link" href="https://iaslab.dei.unipd.it/people/nbellotto/about/">Nicola Bellotto</a> and Prof. <a class="ext_link" href="https://www.hanheide.net/">Marc Hanheide</a>.
<br><br>
Prior to my time in the UK, I graduated from Sapienza University of Rome (Italy). I hold an M.Sc. in Control Engineering, advised by Prof. <a class="ext_link" href="https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/ANTONIO-CARCATERRA_nC1827_EN.aspx">Antonio Carcaterra</a>, and a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Control Engineering, advised by Prof. <a class="ext_link" href="http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/deluca/">Alessandro De Luca</a>.
<br><br>
Between my academic degrees, I gained industrial experience working for one year as a Test Engineer at <a class="ext_link" href="https://www.ferrari.com/">Ferrari</a> and 1.5 years as a Software Specialist at <a class="ext_link" href="https://www.metapack.it/">Metapack Engineering</a>.

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>
I am currently involved in the TopFleets project (partnered with <a class="ext_link" href="https://jabas.ai/">JABAS AI</a>). 
<br>
My research focuses on exploiting causal inference to advance intelligent mobile robotics in dynamic interaction settings, enabling robots to improve prediction, decision-making, and overall autonomy in human-shared environments.
