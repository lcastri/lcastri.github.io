<h2>Research</h2>
<p>
I am currently involved in the European H2020 <a class="ext_link" href="https://darko-project.eu/">DARKO</a> project. 
<br>
My research focuses on exploiting causal inference to advance intelligent mobile robotics in dynamic interaction settings, enabling robots to improve prediction, decision-making, and overall autonomy in human-shared environments.
